Once upon a time, there were 3 little pigs. They each built their own house. Pig one of straw, pig 2 of sticks, pig 3 of bricks.
Pig 1 and 2 finished building really quickly and bullied pig 3 for taking too long. 
However, when the big bad wolf blew their poorly constructed houses down, they regretted making fun of pig 3.
The end.
