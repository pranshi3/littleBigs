Once upon a time, there were 3 little pigs. They each built their own house. Pig one of straw, pig 2 of sticks, pig 3 of bricks.
Pig 1 and 2 finished building really quickly and bullied pig 3 for taking too long. 
However, when the big bad wolf blew their poorly constructed houses down, they regretted making fun of pig 3.
Pig 3, though he accepted the apology, was vengeful and seeked revenge.
So he persuaded the now turned good Big Bad Wolf into joining forces and taking down pig 1 and pig 2 together, inevitbly turning the Big Bad Wolf bad again.
Duh.. duh.. duh
The end.
